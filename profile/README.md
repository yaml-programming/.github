# YAML Programming organization
## Purpose
### Vision
YAML is the number one syntax for writing graphs and graph transformations applied to real world problems.
### Mission
Create open-source tools empowered by YAML's unique features and adoption.

Research applied category theory and publish findings related to categorical syntaxes.

Foster collaboration and integration with existing math and engineering communities.

### Values
Formalism, humanism, self-improvement.

## Participate
Interact with us in any and all ways you like:
Issues, PRs, discussions.
### Research
This project evolves with the latest academic information.
We welcome papers, ideas and your creative process towards our vision.
### Develop
Developers at the core of this formalization effort will need categorical tools.
This is the first step in a new foundation for software engineering.
### Adopt
Resolve existing problems and giving feedback is the best way to gauge our design.
Collaboration is at the heart of this project.
